# Bank_Marketing_Using_Pyspark
Working on Bank Marketing Datasets using Pyspark on Databricks

## About Repository
* This repository contains the project related to bank Marketing dataset. I have applied the Logistic regression, Decision trees and Random forest to comapre the algorithms comparisions in terms of different parameters like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and many other parameters. Also have done hyperparameter tunings using 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the models corresponding to these algorithms and evaluated different parameters.
* **I have provided the code explanation as comments for the concept and syntax for lines of codes in this file**.
* I have implemented the project on databricks community edition.
* The dataset is being taken from https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset
