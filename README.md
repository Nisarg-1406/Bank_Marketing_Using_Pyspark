Working on Bank Marketing Datasets using Pyspark on Databricks

## About Repository
* This repository contains 2 files - Bank Marketing Datasets implemented Using Pyspark and other using only data science libraries using python. 
* Using Pyspark on Databricks - This repository contains the project related to bank Marketing dataset. I have applied the Logistic regression, Decision trees and Random forest to comapre the algorithms comparisions in terms of different parameters like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and many other parameters. Also have done hyperparameter tunings using 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the models corresponding to these algorithms and evaluated different parameters.
* Using Data Science Libraries on Google Colab - In summary, there is first cleaning and preprocessing of data is being done. Then I have compared the different parameter performance against the target variable. Then I have applied, 6 Machine learning Algorithms and compared the train and test accuracy and plotted the ROC Curve for it. The 6 machine learning Algorithms are : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Stacking Classifier, Voting Classifer. 
* **I have provided the code explanation as comments for the concept and syntax for lines of codes in this file**.
* I have implemented the project on databricks community edition.
* The dataset is being taken from https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset
